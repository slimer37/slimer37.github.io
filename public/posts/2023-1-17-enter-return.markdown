*The deal:* Website upgrades.

This is the first blog post this website has seen in the last year. The last one was written this day of 2022. Now I'm back because I realize I really need an online portfolio because I don't have an organized collection of all the cool stuff I've done (and tried to do).

As far as the smallest changes, this site has seen some micro-improvements. I updated the list of software I use and got myself a domain name without `github` in it.

In the time that this website has been practically idle I have graduated from high school and been through my first semester of college. I went to Disneyland with friends, gave a speech at my graduation, and traveled to the Philippines.

I also discontinued the Steam page for Counter Chaos. It's still accessible from old links, but I've wasted all the release visibility events it had so there's not really a chance for any games being sold through that slot. So another $100 is going to Valve once I make a new game for Steam.

Right now I'm finding that some internships I'd like to participate in prefer that I have a collected portfolio, so I'm going to freshen up this website to do that. That includes things *other than a blog*. I doubt I'll begin regular blog posts—almost wrote "I doubt I'll go back to regular posts" but that was never the case—because my ideas go dry after writing just one, maybe two.

So here's a few things I plan to do according to my new personal-website-renovation project in the coming weeks.

* More pages besides this blog to showcase past games and unfinished projects with long descriptions and development logs and information.
* Move About, Projects, and Trike pages outside of the blog page. (If you're reading this after I made this change, they used to be page links in the top-right.)
* Add 3D and UI/Illustration galleries in the same way I'll make the game display pages
* Ensure the next blog post doesn't occur a year apart from this one.
* General quality maintenance.

I don't know if I wanna use Boostrap Studio or try my hand at straight HTML for this. I'll go for raw code first and see what happens.

Besides this list I'm cooking up a large Unity project. And school. Exciting!
