On the Log

All of this was made to post devlogs (developer + logs) because I would prefer not to create laborious video devlogs.
The workload isn't worth it for me but I do love watching others'; especially BWDev's Lumbermill videos.
They're absolutely fascinating. *[See the playlist][lumbermill].*

A part of why I find these so entertaining is because I want to do everything he's doing--the fact that he's making a management game brings me all the more joy.
It's the creation of a game I'd want to play.
He details every step and lets you in on the thinking process before you finally see the beautiful product after failed attempts.

I can relate to that process because I've been through about a year of it.
You keep learning as a programmer and Google keeps holding your hand through the errors.
I plan on having this blog consist of a bunch of documented development just to show the reader how I come up with things and to hopefully provide some interesting insight into the not-so-terrible world of game development.

I wanna show you the bounds of possibility *and* frustration with coding a big project like this.

I've got [3 projects][upcoming] on the to-do list right now and I've put significant work into just the first--the store game.
The store game is a special learning experience for me because, archived, I have a handful of attempts at making the thing that were cut short because of garbage code which led to stagnant progress.
Looking through those in detail would be fun.
Better put it on the backlog.

I didn't write this blog post in a sitting near midnight--I didn't *get* to. But I wanted to.
I was in the mood for work, having written the [about][about], [podcast][podcast], and [projects][upcoming] page.
That writing session brought me up to about 5 medium paragraphs; the rest was completed the next morning.
I don't know if that appears impressive, but I hope it demonstrates how much fun I find in doing work that isn't homework.
Homework could be fun but I rarely see that in AP classes; any class now, really.
Going back to physical I'll no doubt see something I'll enjoy completing, like this group project from English Honors:

![A creative project on Lord of the Flies][lotf]

Writing an employee handbook for a mock-company I formed with some friends also falls under this "fun work" category.

As much as I enjoyed writing all the stuff setting up this blog I doubt I would care enough to uphold a schedule.
If I had to have one it would function more as a suggestion.
About-weekly posts is the best I can offer.
Either that or next week I'll decide to do more than one again.
It depends on my free time.
I always have free time but if work blocks work, the blog gets held up.

Why am I doing more than one this weekend?
Google Ads require that I have some content before I host them which is perfectly reasonable and it pushed me to sit down and fulfill the criterion.
I doubt they require more than one blog post but I'll play it safe.
Besides, I like making these.

I think this is the appropriate blog post length.
According to a Google search, it fits in 2015; present-day asks for 1000+ words.

If I can write about my experiences in a mildly-engaging way that'll be fine and I won't feel the need to stretch it out.
There's where the first post ends.
