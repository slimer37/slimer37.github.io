    <p>I don’t mean oranges.</p>

<p>The original intention was to fill the blog with two starter posts to make it something worth reading–one as an introduction and the second a tour of the store game over the past year or so.
They’re finished and they’re posted but I still had things to write about.
Hey, it’s a good writing exercise.</p>

<p>I see these posts as creative writing.
By working on them my brain gets more used to generating good sentences.
It helps somewhat with English assignments.
If I want some real improvement I’ll insert some sophistication here and there to make scholarly vocabulary and structure commonplace in my brain.
That means–hopefully–it’ll take less effort to answer questions and come up with smart responses.
Ultimately, I want homework to take less time so I can reserve my future self extra free time.</p>

<p>My AP work frontlog is a week long, meaning I have next week’s AP homework done early.
I won’t be withdrawing my saved free time this week.
I’ll keep it handy for when a large assignment crops up or if there’s a week where I can’t bear doing AP homework.
I would love to increase the length of the frontlog to two or even three weeks.</p>

<p>A graph of how much I work through an average week looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/workGraph.png" alt="Graph of work over a week" /></p>

<p><em>If you’re wondering, I made this visual and the one in the <a href="/2021/02/27/supermarket-scramble.html">last post</a> with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/freehand">Freehand</a>.</em></p>

<p>Monday, sometimes Sunday, is often the most intensive day for me.
Notice how the graph never reaches zero.
The average day has at least a little work in it.
Weekends are unpredictable. Either no work is done or a lot of work is done.
Take, for example, a couple weeks ago where I used my weekend to build that frontlog.</p>

<p>It was in <a href="/2021/02/27/on-the-log.html">On the Log</a> where I said I wouldn’t adhere to a schedule.
I’ll probably do bursts like this one, just not all in a couple days (unless I’m especially motivated).
Don’t be surprised if I publish some on weekdays, but they will most likely be on weekends.
I’m aiming for a thousand words with these and I’m fully capable of doing that in a single day (like today) but I don’t think I wanna make and post three in a day ever again.
I don’t have a formal schedule because for this as I can’t guarantee I’ll have something to talk about. If I had to estimate the frequency of these I’d say weekly. 
Or ambiguously biweekly.
Every two weeks?
Twice a week?</p>

<p>I’m not doing this to impress my friends or show off my skills in any way, no; I want a blog because I want my stamp on the internet.
A place separate from all my private stuff to serve as something between a scrapbook and a portfolio.
And to show ads.</p>

<p>If I find myself in a conversation and I’m given the opportunity to mention my blog to a potential reader.
It’s a different deal with the podcast because it’s not that I don’t like the sound of my voice but it feels odd to hear it.
When you listen to yourself again you’re prone to thinking of the perfect thing to say and unfairly judging whatever you said.
It’s awkward is all I’m saying and I’m content with whoever I’m talking to knowing about the podcast but I’ll more freely give out a blog link.
Voice vs. text.</p>

<p>Hearing my voice is more awkward than reading my writing.
First impressions with text are easier.
All you need is an elegant typeface and a good introduction.
Vocal media is much more difficult to satisfy.
Pronounce the words well and come up with the right words if, like in a podcast, no script is prepared.
In the moment, it feels like the right thing; but part of the brain is occupied with reacting and responding to co-hosts than ensuring eloquency.
As such, mistakes that work against the point will inevitably find a way in.</p>

<p>With both voice and text you’ll obviously want good ideas presented with whatever you’re saying–if not good ideas then funny or entertaining ideas.
A blog allows me to think about the words more than a podcast does.
To review what you say like you review written work you’d need to stop time.
I’ll always be more satisfied with something I typed than stuff I said.
Being able to edit is something I’m very grateful for.</p>

<p>Maybe in a decade I can look back on this if it’s still up.
It’ll be interesting to see my thought processes and mindset and skill evolve over a long period.
This is my time capsule.
Or one of them.</p>

<p>I hope I get a Creative Cloud subscription in the future.</p>
