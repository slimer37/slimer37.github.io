    <p>The deal is I want a blog but I have a lack of motivation to write for it. Every so often an idea for a blog post will pop up in my head but ultimately it never makes it to the actual blog feed. I start off a markdown file like this one and get a good foothold on an idea but the second I stop writing, the post dies.</p>

<p>I realize now I started this blog for the <em>wrongest</em> reasons. I just wanted a place to put some Google ads onto. Tried, rejected. If I know anything, don’t commit to a project <em>just</em> for the payout. The payout is fine as partial motivation but definitely not the majority; it’s in the same vein as liking your job–you can be passionate about it and still want fair compensation. Similarly, being underpaid for your work is something to resist.</p>

<p>My workflow for blog stuff is not established but it’s going to have to be if I want to justify grabbing a free domain name, courtesy of GitHub and its partners. If I want to justify getting ads for this site, I’ll have to do the same as well. Short bursts every year will not cut it. It’s been nearly a whole year since the last post! All the previous posts were put up the same day, as a matter of fact. If there are ads somewhere on here, blame me for wanting a quarter-a-month salary. I don’t have a job, so it would be an improvement.</p>

<p>Speaking of domain names, some eccentric TLDs are available: <em>.rocks, .ninja, .codes, .email (why?)</em>… I like <em>.studio</em> for a professional setup and <em>.me</em> for a personal page. The plan is to swipe a domain name, use it for a landing page, and split up this website into either subdomains or subdirectories. The other tabs (About, Projects, Trike) shouldn’t be overshadowed by a blog page. Frontlog shouldn’t be the main thing but as of writing, it is. If the page you’re on right now isn’t <em>slimer37.github.io</em>, then I was successful. Otherwise, wait a few years while I procrastinate.</p>

<p>Speaking of procrastination, my frontlog is no longer in service. That is, I have nothing done in advance at the moment–if you wanna call two days a frontlog, that’s just wishful thinking. A frontlog should be at least a week, if you ask me. Ought not to call this blog <em>Frontlog</em> since I’m getting nothing done with it.</p>

<p>I’m still trying to lay a little looser with the language on here; by that I mean less formal, less big words, more paragraphs of how I really talk and less of how I try to write in Honors English. (Speaking of speaking, I finished my final English class of high-school and it feels fantastic. Now I just have AP Chemistry and Calculus to run through.)</p>

<p>Going back to the website expansion plans reminded me of a bunch of plans I had for various, and impossibly ambitious, game-making missions. I remember making a serious attempt to work on three games at the same time, four at one point, and shelving all but one after months of futile work and underdeveloped ideas. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1835160/Counter_Chaos/">Counter Chaos</a> was underdeveloped too (still is) but I was most attached to it for some reason.</p>

<p>So I’ll keep throwing code at the game until it’s done. Hopefully I’ll have a playable, enjoyable, beautiful and perfect demo (for all I know it’ll be none of those) done by the end of the month or at least by mid-February. Wait out for it until March or until I start making a big deal about it again.</p>
