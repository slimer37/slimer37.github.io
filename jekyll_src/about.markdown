Welcome to my blog.

Expect devlogs of progress on all my projects and some informal things. I use [Unity][unity], a game engine I've been learning for a little over a year. I started coding with C# the summer of 2019 and experimented in other programming languages: C++, Python, JavaScript, and Java. I attempted HTML/CSS and SQL for a while but realized making a website and managing databases are hardly my strong suits.

*Frontlog* derives from my tendency to sit down and commit to long bouts of work and decimate the backlog. You might see me do this with homework or personal projects. If you wanna see what I'm working on, there's a list on the [Current Projects][projectPage] page at the top.

You can visit my [GitHub profile][githubProfile], but there won't be much. (The same link is at the bottom of the page.) If I decide to make any open-source software or tech demos someday, you'll find them there.

# My tools:
- The [Unity][unity] game engine
- [Jetbrains Rider][rider] for Unity and other C# development
- [Blender][blender] to make 3D models
- [Affinity Designer][afd] for icons, logos, and some texturing
- [Aseprite][aseprite] for pixel-art
- [Visual Studio Code][vsCode] to edit blog posts, stuff other than C# files, or for simpler projects. I love the available color themes.

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-generated site hosted with [GitHub][githubProfile]--I recommend it if you're looking to make something of your own. It's much easier than manual HTML.
