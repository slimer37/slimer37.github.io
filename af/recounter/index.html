            RECOUNTER is a business-management simulator where youâ€™re the only employee out on the floor.
            <br><br>
            You, the entrepreneur, are in desperate need of a business idea to satisfy your life goals. You've always
            wanted a store and so you start one, taking out a decent business loan for the endeavor. But the only kind
            of job that will gratify you is one where you are the boss...and the cashier. And the janitor. And the guy
            who opens the boxes. Or assembles the furniture. Or catalogs inventory. You display items on shelves, unload
            trucks, deal with customers, and get to keep aaaalll the money.
            <br><br>
            Start out with a small store and sell your way up. As you earn money, you can use them on upgrades like
            better advertising to get more customers in or faster deliveries to stock up faster. Just one possible
            consequence during your career is poor management; it's just a fact of single-employee-boss-janitor
            establishments that try to make it big time. But that's not you, is it?
            <br><br>
            As they say: if you want something done right, do it yourself.
