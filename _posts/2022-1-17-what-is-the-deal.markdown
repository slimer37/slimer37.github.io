title: "What's the Deal?"
---

The deal is I want a blog but I have a lack of motivation to write for it. Every so often an idea for a blog post will pop up in my head but ultimately it never makes it to the actual blog feed. I start off a markdown file like this one and get a good foothold on an idea but the second I stop writing, the post dies.

I realize now I started this blog for the *wrongest* reasons. I just wanted a place to put some Google ads onto. Tried, rejected. If I know anything, don't commit to a project *just* for the payout. The payout is fine as partial motivation but definitely not the majority; it's in the same vein as liking your job--you can be passionate about it and still want fair compensation. Similarly, being underpaid for your work is something to resist.

My workflow for blog stuff is not established but it's going to have to be if I want to justify grabbing a free domain name, courtesy of GitHub and its partners. If I want to justify getting ads for this site, I'll have to do the same as well. Short bursts every year will not cut it. It's been nearly a whole year since the last post! All the previous posts were put up the same day, as a matter of fact. If there are ads somewhere on here, blame me for wanting a quarter-a-month salary. I don't have a job, so it would be an improvement.

Speaking of domain names, some eccentric TLDs are available: *.rocks, .ninja, .codes, .email (why?)*... I like *.studio* for a professional setup and *.me* for a personal page. The plan is to swipe a domain name, use it for a landing page, and split up this website into either subdomains or subdirectories. The other tabs (About, Projects, Trike) shouldn't be overshadowed by a blog page. Frontlog shouldn't be the main thing but as of writing, it is. If the page you're on right now isn't *slimer37.github.io*, then I was successful. Otherwise, wait a few years while I procrastinate.

Speaking of procrastination, my frontlog is no longer in service. That is, I have nothing done in advance at the moment--if you wanna call two days a frontlog, that's just wishful thinking. A frontlog should be at least a week, if you ask me. Ought not to call this blog *Frontlog* since I'm getting nothing done with it.

I'm still trying to lay a little looser with the language on here; by that I mean less formal, less big words, more paragraphs of how I really talk and less of how I try to write in Honors English. (Speaking of speaking, I finished my final English class of high-school and it feels fantastic. Now I just have AP Chemistry and Calculus to run through.)

Going back to the website expansion plans reminded me of a bunch of plans I had for various, and impossibly ambitious, game-making missions. I remember making a serious attempt to work on three games at the same time, four at one point, and shelving all but one after months of futile work and underdeveloped ideas. [Counter Chaos][cc] was underdeveloped too (still is) but I was most attached to it for some reason.

So I'll keep throwing code at the game until it's done. Hopefully I'll have a playable, enjoyable, beautiful and perfect demo (for all I know it'll be none of those) done by the end of the month or at least by mid-February. Wait out for it until March or until I start making a big deal about it again.
