Welcome to my blog.

Expect devlogs of progress on all my projects and some informal things. I use [Unity][unity], a game engine I've been learning for a little over a year. I started coding with C# the summer of 2019 and experimented in other programming languages: C++, Python, JavaScript, and Java. I attempted HTML/CSS for a while but realized making a website is hardly my strong suit.

*Frontlog* derives from my tendency to sit down and commit to long bouts of work and decimate the backlog. You might see me do this with homework or personal projects. If you wanna see what I'm working on, there's a list on the [Current Projects][projectPage] page at the top.

You can visit my [GitHub profile][githubProfile], but there won't be much. (The same link is at the bottom of the page.) If I decide to make any open-source software or tech demos, you'll find them there. The only public repository for actual software I have there now is an abandoned Rubik's Cube Unity simulation.

# My tools:
- The [Unity][unity] game engine
- Microsoft's [Visual Studio][vs] for Unity development
  - I use [Visual Studio Code][vsCode] occassionally (also by Microsoft), usually for working away from home or for simpler projects. I love the available color themes.
- [Blender][blender] to make 3D models
- [Aseprite][aseprite] for pixel-art
- [Notepad++][nppp] to edit blog posts and other non-code files

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-generated site hosted with [GitHub][githubProfile]--I recommend it if you're looking to make something of your own. It's much easier than manual HTML.
